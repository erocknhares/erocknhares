## About this Instance
The source for tools and docs developed by Eastern Rockingham County New Hampshire Amateur Radio Emergency Service (ERCNHARES) is here.

Whereas many gits are mainly homes for single projects, our repositories include suites of code not intended to be compiled into single applications as well. That said, we do have and welcome development projects intended to benefit the organization. 

## Contact Info
If you are a developer and have a project idea or wish to contribute to an existing Amateur Radio-related development project, contact the ERCNHARES development team at ercnharesdev@gmail.com.
